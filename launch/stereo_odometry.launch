    <!--
        The purpose of this launch file is conversion of raw stereo into stereo odometry, consumed by the EKF and rtab map.
        There are three stages to this conversion:
            (1) decompress the raw stereo images
            (2) rectify the unrectified (fisheye) images
            (3) convert the rectified images to odometry

        Note: YOU DO NOT NEED TO LAUNCH THIS FILE DIRECTLY, it will be launched by "autonomous_mapping.launch".

        Note: the stereo_odometry node requires transforms between base_link and the stereo camera frames. These are published
        by "robot_state.launch" (which is automatically run when you launch this file).
