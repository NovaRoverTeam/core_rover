    This launch file spins up publishers to the transform tree, necessary to publish transforms between:
    * base_link and the stero camera frames
    * base_link and the lidar

    Note: YOU DO NOT NEED TO RUN THIS LAUNCH FILE DIRECTLY, it will automatically be run whenever you run
    "stereo_odometry.launch" is run (which, in turn, is run whenever "autonomous_localization.launch" is run).
